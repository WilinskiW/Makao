## Introduction
**Makao** is a 2D card game developed in Java using the **LibGDX** framework.

### Key Features:
- **Game Mechanics:** Implements the rules of the traditional **Makao** card game, allowing **players** to engage in virtual matches.  
- **Graphics and Assets:** Contains an `assets` directory, which likely includes visual and audio resources essential for the game's interface and experience.  
- **Code Architecture:** Follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern to structure the code efficiently, ensuring better separation of concerns and maintainability.  

> *This project serves as a digital adaptation of the Makao card game, leveraging Java and LibGDX to offer an interactive gaming experience.*

## Technology Stack
- **Java**
- **Gradle**
- **Game Library:** LibGDX

## Game Rules

### Main Goal
The objective of the game is to **get rid of all your cards** before your opponents do.

### Setup
- Each player is dealt **five cards**.
- The remaining deck is placed **face down** as the draw pile.
- The **top card** from the draw pile is placed **face up** to start the discard pile.

### Gameplay
- Players take turns **in a clockwise direction**.
- On their turn, a player must **play a card** that matches the **rank or suit** of the top card in the discard pile.
- If a player **cannot play**, they must **draw one card** from the draw pile. If this card is playable, they can play it immediately; otherwise, their turn ends.

### Special Cards and Their Effects
- **2:** The next player must **draw two cards** or play another '2' to pass the penalty to the subsequent player.
- **3:** Similar to '2', but the penalty is **three cards**.
- **4:** **Skips** the next player's turn.
- **Jack (J):** The player can request a **specific rank** from the next player, who must then play a card of that rank or a **Jack** to change the requested rank.
- **Queen (Q):** Can be **played on any card**, and any card can be played on a Queen.
- **King of Hearts:** The next player must **draw five cards**.
- **King of Spades:** The previous player must **draw five cards**.
- **Ace (A):** Allows the player to **change the current suit**.
- **Joker:** Acts as a **wildcard**, substituting for any card or effect.

### Additional Rules
- **Makao Declaration:** When a human player has only **one card left**, they must **declare "Makao!"** before the next playerâ€™s turn. **Failing to do so results in a penalty of drawing one card.**
- **Stacking Penalties:** Penalties from **'2's and '3's** can be stacked. For example, if a player plays a '2', the next player can play another '2', increasing the penalty to **four cards** for the subsequent player.
